# Quick Tip: console.log() One Liners

We all love one-liners, right? They're beautiful, concise, easy to read and easy to write. But what if you want to log to the console? Then you've got to add a bunch of extra code to make it work. I've got a quick tip for you that will allow you to log to the console in one-liners.



```js
// one-liners are great!
[1,2,3,4,5].map(num => num +1)
// but what if you want to log to console ??
// you could do all this
[1,2,3,4,5].map((num) => {
	console.log(num)
	return num +1
})
// orrrrr
[1,2,3,4,5].map(num => console.log(num) || num +1)

```

Nice!
