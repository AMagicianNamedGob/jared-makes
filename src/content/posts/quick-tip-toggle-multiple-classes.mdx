# Quick Tip: JavaScript Toggle Multiple Classes

Recently I was working on building a [dead simple light box](https://codepen.io/JaredsPens/pen/oNPbZXx?editors=1010) that required me to toggle multiple classes on a single element. Rather than writing a bunch of `el.classList.toggle()` statements, I decided to write a function that would just do it for me.

```js

function toggleClasses(el, ...classes) {
  classes.map(class) => el.classList.toggle(class)
}

// Usage

const el = document.querySelector('.my-element');
el.addEventListener('click',
  () => toggleClasses(el, 'class1', 'class2', 'class3'));

```

That's it. Pretty simple, right? I hope you find this useful.
